# Motor-Control
Simulation of a PWM-based motor control with LCD monitoring, built in SimulIDE and Arduino IDE
This project demonstrates a basic motor control system using an Arduino Uno, simulated in SimulIDE. The motor speed is controlled via PWM, the LCD displays real-time voltage and ON/OFF state, and serial communication (USART) provides logs to the monitor. Includes .sim1 simulation file, Arduino .ino sketch, and compiled .hex file

## üîß Features
![Alt text](Layout.png)
- Control motor speed using PWM
- Display motor ON/OFF state and voltage on LCD
- USART logging to serial monitor
- Built in SimulIDE with schematic provided

## ‚öôÔ∏è Description of Operation
- The motor is driven by PWM from the Arduino Uno and its speed is controlled based on the input voltage.
- An LCD displays the motor status (`ON/OFF`), applied voltage, and calculated motor speed.
- **Speed Calculation:**
  he speed (%) is proportional to the applied input voltage relative to the maximum supply voltage of 5V

- The LCD shows both the percentage (%) and the real-time voltage value.
- An LED indicator will turn **ON** when the motor speed exceeds 50%.

## üöÄ Project Files
- `MotorLogic.ino` ‚Üí Arduino Code
- `Motor_Firmware.hex` ‚Üí Compiled hex
- `SchematicLayout.sim1` ‚Üí SimulIDE project file
- `Layout.png` ‚Üí Project schematic screenshot

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Usage Notes
- **Button Operation**: Gently press and hold the motor toggle button for approximately 150ms (about 1/6 of a second) to ensure reliable state changes. Quick taps may not register properly due to debouncing protection.
- **Motor Response**: The system includes deliberate debounce delays to prevent accidental double-toggles and protect the motor from rapid state changes.
- **Serial Monitor**: USART1 logs display detailed system status including motor speed in km/h, button states, and PWM values for debugging purposes.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open `SchematicLayout.sim1` in **SimulIDE**.
2. Upload `Motor_Firmware.hex` into the Arduino board inside SimulIDE.
3. Open the serial monitor to view USART logs.
4. Adjust motor control input to test speed variation.
